# Breast Cancer Classification using ML
This project is a part of the ADS-502 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego. <br>
-- Project Status: [Completed]

# Objective
This project was intended to analyze the fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass and classify the observations as either benign or malignant. The dataset was obtained from the University of California in Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository as a CSV file with 569 observations of cell nuclei. 

The following methods were applied using Python:
- Logistic regressions
- K-means clustering
- Random forests (C5.0 & CART)
- Decision trees

This study evaluated the dataset using dimensionality reduction techniques and calculations of the possible outcomes: True Positive, True Negative, False Negative, and False Positive. We used the performance metric, accuracy, to assess the proposed models and found that the logistic regression method is able to better categorize malignant and benign tumors with compared to other machine learning algorithms, the logistic regression method is better able to compute and categorize malignant and benign tumors with greater accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score compared to the other models.
